You need a Linux System, I use Ubuntu 11.4 64 bit

1. Download hpkf.tar.gz File

hpkf.tar.gz

2. Extract file to your home/user folder, you should now have a /home/user/hpkf folder

3. Open Terminal

4. MAKE YOUR zImage

$ cd hpkf/kernel
$ make clean
$ make mrproper
$ cp prevailconfig .config
$ make

Compile will take a little while, when it is done the zImage will be in

/home/user/hpkf/kernel/arch/arm/boot/



5. PACK zImage with a ramdisk (BOOT or RECOERY)

Make CM7 Beta 5 Kernel (BOOT) Flashable with ClockWorkMOD
$ cd ../pack
$ ./cwmboot.pl cmbeta5

Make Kouma 1.3 Kernel (BOOT) Flashable with Odin
$ cd ../pack
$ ./odinboot.pl kouma13

Make ClockWorkMOD 5.0.2.7 (RECOERY) Flashable with ClockWorkMOD
$ cd ../pack
$ ./cwmrecov.pl CWM5027

Make ClockWorkMOD 5.0.2.7 (RECOERY) Flashable with Odin
$ cd ../pack
$ ./odinrecov.pl CWM5027

Either a ZIP or a TAR file will be located in the /home/user/hpkf/pack folder depending on what you chose to make
